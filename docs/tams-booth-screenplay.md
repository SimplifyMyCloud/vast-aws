# "THE VAULT" - A TAMS + VAST Demo Screenplay

**FADE IN:**

### INT. TRADE SHOW FLOOR - IBC AMSTERDAM - DAY

*The VAST booth gleams with massive displays showing racing footage. A weary BROADCAST EXEC (50s, ESPN polo shirt) approaches, dragging a roller bag.*

**VAST ENGINEER**  
*(enthusiastic)*  
You look like someone sitting on a goldmine they can't access.

**BROADCAST EXEC**  
*(sighs)*  
Try 100 petabytes of NASCAR footage. Forty years worth. All on LTO tape in a warehouse costing us $50K a month. My CFO wants to throw it away.

**VAST ENGINEER**  
What if I told you that footage could be making you millions instead of costing you thousands?

*The Engineer gestures to the screen showing a NASCAR race - cars blazing around turn 3 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.*

**VAST ENGINEER** *(CONT'D)*  
This is 30 minutes of 4K footage we ingested yesterday. Watch this.  
*(types)*  
"How many seconds has the Lucas Oil logo appears on screen?"

*The TAMS interface instantly highlights timeline segments. A counter shows: "27.3 seconds total."*

**BROADCAST EXEC**  
*(leaning in)*  
Wait, Lucas Oil pays for 30 seconds minimum per race...

**VAST ENGINEER**  
Exactly. You could auto-verify every sponsorship contract in your archive. But watch this—  
*(types)*  
"Find every crash where a car spun into the infield grass."

*Six dramatic crash sequences appear instantly, perfectly cut.*

**VAST ENGINEER** *(CONT'D)*  
Now imagine your social media team having instant access to create viral moments. Your sales team building custom highlight reels for sponsors. Your production team finding that perfect shot from 1987 in seconds, not days.

**BROADCAST EXEC**  
But we have 100 petabytes. The cloud storage alone would—

**VAST ENGINEER**  
*(interrupting with a smile)*  
VAST's all-flash architecture costs less than your current tape storage. No retrieval fees. No glacier delays. Every frame accessible in milliseconds, all on premise and lightning fast. 

*The screen splits showing cost comparison: Current: $600K/year vs VAST+TAMS: $400K/year*

**VAST ENGINEER** *(CONT'D)*  
Plus, TAMS automatically extracts metadata during ingest. Every logo, every pass, every crash - searchable instantly. Your archive becomes a living asset.

*The Exec pulls out his phone, starts texting furiously.*

**BROADCAST EXEC**  
I'm getting my CFO down here. Can you show this with Formula 1 footage?

**VAST ENGINEER**  
*(grinning)*  
Already loaded. Want to see every overtake Verstappen made in wet conditions?

*The screen transforms to F1 footage. The Exec's eyes widen.*

**BROADCAST EXEC**  
We've been sitting on lottery tickets, haven't we?

**VAST ENGINEER**  
No. You've been sitting on hope diamonds. TAMS and VAST just gave you the printing press.

**FADE TO:** *VAST logo with tagline: "Your Archive. Activated."*

## THE PITCH POINTS

**THE PROBLEM**: Massive media archives trapped on tape = Dead money  
**THE PAIN**: $50K+/month storage costs with zero ROI  
**THE SOLUTION**: VAST storage + TAMS intelligence = Instant monetization  
**THE PROOF**: Real-time demo showing sponsor verification & content creation  
**THE CLOSE**: Lower costs + New revenue streams = CFO approval

*"Turn your archive from a cost center into a profit center."*
