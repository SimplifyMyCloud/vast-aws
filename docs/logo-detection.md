# Logo Detection in AI Video Processing

This document describes the logo detection capabilities integrated into the VAST-TAMS AI video processing pipeline.

## Overview

The AI video processing system now includes advanced logo detection that identifies branded content, sponsor logos, and product placements in video streams. This feature automatically marks scenes containing logos as "worthy" and provides detailed metadata about logo appearances.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

1. **Multi-scale Template Matching**
   - Detects logos at different sizes (0.5x to 1.5x scale)
   - Adapts to logos appearing at various distances from camera

2. **Frame-by-frame Analysis**
   - Tracks logo appearances throughout scenes
   - Samples frames at configurable intervals (default: every 30 frames)

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Rates detection accuracy (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
   - Configurable threshold (default: 0.7)

4. **Position Tracking**
   - Records X/Y coordinates where logos appear
   - Tracks logo movement across frames

5. **Timeline Mapping**
   - Captures first appearance timestamp
   - Records last appearance timestamp
   - Counts total detections per scene

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare Logo Templates

Run the logo preparation script to create initial templates:

```bash
python3 prepare-logos.py
```

This creates templates for common logos:
- NVIDIA (green)
- AWS (orange)
- VAST (blue)
- BBC (black)
- Netflix (red)
- YouTube (red)
- Apple (black)
- Google (blue)
- Microsoft (blue)
- Meta (blue)

### 2. Add Custom Logos

To detect specific logos in your videos:

1. Create a directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./logo_templates
   ```

2. Add logo images:
   - Format: PNG or JPG
   - Naming: `companyname.png` or `brandname.jpg`
   - Best practices:
     - Use high-quality images
     - Include transparent backgrounds if possible
     - Provide multiple sizes/variations for better detection

3. Example structure:
   ```
   ./logo_templates/
   ├── nvidia.png
   ├── aws.png
   ├── vast.png
   ├── your-company.png
   └── variations/
       ├── nvidia_gray.png
       ├── nvidia_scale75.png
       └── nvidia_inverted.png
   ```

### 3. Configure Detection Settings

Edit the configuration in `process-videos-ai.py`:

```python
LOGO_CONFIG = {
    'detect_logos': True,                    # Enable/disable logo detection
    'logo_templates_dir': './logo_templates', # Directory containing logos
    'confidence_threshold': 0.7,             # Minimum confidence (0.0-1.0)
    'use_deep_learning': False,              # Use YOLO/CNN if available
    'common_logos': [                        # List of logos to detect
        'nvidia', 'aws', 'vast', 'bbc', 
        'netflix', 'youtube', 'apple', 'google'
    ]
}
```

## How It Works

### Detection Process

1. **Scene Analysis**
   - System detects scene changes in video
   - Each scene is analyzed for logo presence

2. **Template Matching**
   - Compares video frames against logo templates
   - Uses OpenCV's template matching algorithms
   - Checks multiple scales to handle size variations

3. **Aggregation**
   - Combines detections across frames
   - Calculates average confidence scores
   - Tracks logo persistence in scenes

4. **Worthiness Determination**
   - Scenes with logos are automatically marked as "worthy"
   - Ensures branded content is captured for analysis

### Detection Algorithm

```python
# For each scene in video:
for scene in scenes:
    # Sample frames at regular intervals
    for frame in sample_frames(scene, interval=30):
        # Detect logos using template matching
        logos = detect_logos_in_frame(frame)
        
        # Aggregate results
        for logo in logos:
            update_scene_metadata(scene, logo)
    
    # Mark scene as worthy if logos detected
    if scene.has_logos():
        scene.is_worthy = True
```

## TAMS Integration

### Segment Metadata Structure

Each video segment stored in TAMS includes comprehensive logo information:

```json
{
  "segment_number": 3,
  "start_time": 45.2,
  "end_time": 72.8,
  "metadata": {
    "duration": 27.6,
    "motion_score": 3.2,
    "is_worthy": true,
    "tags": ["has-logos", "logo:nvidia", "logo:aws", "moderate-motion"],
    "logos_detected": [
      {
        "name": "nvidia",
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "first_seen": 46.1,
        "last_seen": 68.3,
        "detection_count": 15
      },
      {
        "name": "aws",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "first_seen": 52.4,
        "last_seen": 65.7,
        "detection_count": 8
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Flow Metadata

The overall flow includes logo summary:

```json
{
  "flow_id": "abc123",
  "metadata": {
    "total_scenes": 24,
    "worthy_scenes": 12,
    "logos_detected": {
      "total_detections": 47,
      "unique_logos": ["nvidia", "aws", "vast"],
      "logo_count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## Racing-Specific Logo Detection

For racing videos, we provide a specialized detection system (`process-racing-sponsors.py`) that addresses the unique challenges of motorsports:

### Key Features for Racing

1. **Car Detection First**
   - Identifies race cars by color and shape analysis
   - Filters by size and aspect ratio (cars are longer than tall)
   - Focuses detection only on car regions for better accuracy

2. **Motion Compensation**
   - Handles blur from fast-moving cars with sharpening filters
   - Applies denoising to improve logo visibility
   - Compensates for camera shake and motion artifacts

3. **Multi-angle Detection**
   - Cars turn and bank, causing logos to appear at various angles
   - Template matching with rotation compensation (-30° to +30°)
   - Scale-invariant detection for cars at different distances

4. **Persistence Tracking**
   - Tracks how long each sponsor remains visible
   - Associates sponsors with specific car colors
   - Generates timeline analysis of sponsor appearances

### Racing Sponsor Categories

```python
RACING_SPONSORS = {
    'oil_fuel': ['shell', 'mobil1', 'castrol', 'petronas', 'gulf'],
    'tires': ['pirelli', 'michelin', 'bridgestone', 'goodyear'],
    'beverages': ['redbull', 'monster', 'rockstar', 'cocacola'],
    'manufacturers': ['ferrari', 'mercedes', 'mclaren', 'porsche', 'audi'],
    'luxury': ['rolex', 'tag-heuer', 'richard-mille'],
    'technology': ['oracle', 'aws', 'microsoft', 'dell', 'hp'],
    'logistics': ['fedex', 'ups', 'dhl'],
    'financial': ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex', 'santander']
}
```

### Racing Detection Process

```python
# 1. Detect race cars in frame
cars = detect_cars(frame)  # Color + shape analysis

# 2. For each car, extract sponsor regions
for car in cars:
    car_region = extract_car_region(frame, car.bbox)
    
    # 3. Apply motion blur compensation
    enhanced = compensate_motion_blur(car_region)
    
    # 4. Multi-scale + multi-angle logo detection
    sponsors = detect_sponsors_robust(enhanced, templates)
    
    # 5. Track sponsor persistence over time
    update_sponsor_timeline(sponsors, timestamp)
```

### Racing Analytics Output

The racing system generates comprehensive sponsor analytics:

```json
{
  "sponsor_rankings": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "sponsor": "shell",
      "screen_time_seconds": 45.2,
      "detections": 127,
      "confidence": 0.89,
      "associated_cars": ["red", "yellow"]
    },
    {
      "rank": 2, 
      "sponsor": "redbull",
      "screen_time_seconds": 38.7,
      "detections": 98,
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "associated_cars": ["blue", "red"]
    }
  ],
  "timeline_analysis": {
    "peak_sponsor_visibility": "2:15 - 2:45",
    "sponsor_transitions": 23,
    "average_sponsors_per_frame": 2.4
  }
}
```

```

### Racing Demo Output

```
SPONSOR DETECTION SUMMARY
========================================
Video: monaco-gp.mp4
Unique sponsors detected: 8

Top Sponsors by Screen Time:
  #1 shell          - 45.2s (127 detections, 89% confidence)
  #2 redbull        - 38.7s (98 detections, 92% confidence)  
  #3 petronas       - 31.4s (76 detections, 85% confidence)
  #4 pirelli        - 28.9s (88 detections, 91% confidence)
  #5 ferrari        - 22.1s (54 detections, 87% confidence)
```

### Racing-Specific TAMS Integration

Racing segments include detailed sponsor metadata:

```json
{
  "segment_type": "racing",
  "sponsors_visible": ["shell", "redbull", "pirelli"],
  "dominant_sponsors": ["shell", "redbull"],
  "sponsor_details": {
    "shell": {
      "appearances": 15,
      "cars": ["red", "yellow"],
      "peak_confidence": 0.94
    }
  },
  "tags": ["racing", "sponsors", "sponsor:shell", "sponsor:redbull"]
}
```

This racing-specific approach provides much more accurate detection and meaningful analytics for motorsports applications, including sponsor ROI measurement, visibility tracking, and competitive analysis.

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Deep Learning Models

For improved accuracy with complex logos:

```python
LOGO_CONFIG = {
    'use_deep_learning': True,  # Enable YOLO/CNN
    'model_path': './models/logo_detector.pt',
    'model_confidence': 0.5
}
```

### Custom Detection Parameters

Adjust detection sensitivity:

```python
# In detect_logos_in_video()
sample_rate = 15  # Check every 15 frames (more thorough)
scales = [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 2.0]  # More scale variations
```

### Parallel Processing

For faster processing of multiple videos:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = executor.map(process_video, video_list)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Detection Rate**
   - Ensure logo templates are high quality
   - Adjust confidence threshold lower (e.g., 0.5)
   - Add more scale variations
   - Create multiple template variations

2. **False Positives**
   - Increase confidence threshold (e.g., 0.8)
   - Use more specific logo templates
   - Enable deep learning mode

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Increase sample_rate (check fewer frames)
   - Reduce number of scale variations
   - Process videos in parallel

### Debug Mode
